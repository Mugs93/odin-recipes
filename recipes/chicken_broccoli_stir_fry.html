            <li>Gather Ingredients</li>
            <li>Heat oil in large non stick skillet over medium-high heat, about 
                2 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together chicken and 1 tbsp of cornstarch 
                in a medium bowl until chicken is coated.

                and cook, stirring often, until translucent, about 1 minute. Add 
                ginger and garlic. Cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 
                1 minute. Transfer chicken mixture to a plate and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Add broccoli to empty skillet and cook over medium-high, stirring 
                occasionally, until bright green and heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, whisk together water, soy sauce, oyster sauce, brown sugar, 
                crushed red pepper, black pepper, and remaining 2 tbsp cornstarch in a 
                small bowl until smooth, about 30 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>Add cooked chicken mixture to broccoli in skillet. Add soy sauce mixture 
                and cook, stirring constantly, until broccoli and chicken are well coated,
